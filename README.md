# Overview

I've created a simple game of "Whack-A-Mole." The object of the game is to hit the mole with the mallet. If the bunny is hit, the player loses points. With increases in levels, the moles/bunnies pop out of their holes faster.

My purpose for writing this game is to learn how to use the Arcade library in Python and to gain experience designing and developing a simple interactive game.

# Development Environment

Tools that were used to create my game include installation of the Arcade library, original drawings courtesy of Myla Y., the resource list from Arcade Academy, and Visual Studio Code. 

The primary programming lanuage used to create my game was Python.

# Future Work


* In the code, I can group and split the functions into separate Python files and import as needed so the code doesn't seem as long and cluttered
* Visually make it more appealing to play and not look as basic
* Start the game with only moles, then start adding bunnies later in the game.
* Add volume options for sound effects and music.

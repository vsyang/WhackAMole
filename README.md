# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* In the code, I can split the functions into separate classes/Python files and import as needed so the code doesn't seem as long
* Adding sound effects for hitting correct and incorrect Sprites
* Visually make it more appealing to play and not look as basic
